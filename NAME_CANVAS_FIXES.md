# TextToParticles - Fixed Name & Canvas Issues ✨

## 🎯 Issues Fixed

### 1. **Name Clarity Improved**
- ✅ **Larger Font Size**: Increased from 80px to 100px (desktop) and 60px to 70px (mobile)
- ✅ **Bolder Weight**: Changed from 700 to 800 font weight for better particle detection
- ✅ **More Particles**: Reduced step size from 12px to 8px for denser letter formation
- ✅ **Better Density**: Increased default density to 1.0 for clearer name visibility
- ✅ **Stronger Attraction**: Particles form letters more clearly (from /2000 to /1200)

### 2. **Canvas Area Expanded**
- ✅ **Increased Height**: From 180px to 280px (much more space for star movement)
- ✅ **Better Minimum Height**: From 140px to 240px for consistent sizing
- ✅ **Added Overflow Hidden**: Prevents any visual artifacts
- ✅ **Component Height**: Updated to min-h-[240px] md:min-h-[280px]
- ✅ **Boundary Protection**: Added padding system to keep stars visible

### 3. **Enhanced Star Behavior**
- ✅ **Boundary Limits**: Stars now stay within visible area with 50px padding
- ✅ **Slightly Stronger Interaction**: Increased mouse repulsion for better visibility
- ✅ **Larger Interaction Radius**: From 80px to 100px for smoother experience
- ✅ **Bigger Star Size**: From 1.5px to 1.8px for better visibility

## 🌟 Technical Improvements

### **Canvas Dimensions**
```tsx
height: "280px"        // Was 180px - 55% larger canvas
minHeight: "240px"     // Was 140px - 71% larger minimum
```

### **Font Rendering**
```tsx
fontSize: 100px        // Was 80px - 25% larger font
fontWeight: 800        // Was 700 - bolder for better detection
```

### **Particle Settings**
```tsx
step: 5-8px           // Was 8-12px - more particles
density: 1.0          // Was 0.6 - 67% more particles
attraction: /1200     // Was /2000 - 67% stronger
```

### **Boundary System**
```tsx
padding: 50px         // New feature - keeps stars visible
overflow: "hidden"    // Prevents canvas overflow
```

## 🎨 Visual Result

Your name "SANTOSH KUMAR" now:
- **Forms much clearer** with more particles defining each letter
- **Stays fully visible** with expanded canvas area
- **Never disappears** thanks to boundary protection system
- **Interacts smoothly** with larger interaction radius
- **Looks more prominent** with bigger, brighter stars
